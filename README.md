# VBA-Challenge
This repository contains my submission for the Module 2 Challenge due on 10/28. 
All of the work present has been created by myself, Molly Pfefferkorn. 
My instructor, Dr. Carl Arrington, provided troubleshooting feedback during the designated office hours of this class. 
Data for this dataset was generated by edX Boot Camps LLC, and is intended for educational purposes only.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For this assignment, I created a VBA script to analyze stock market data from multiple worksheets representing different quarters. The VBA script loops through each stock's data for every quarter and retrieves key values, including the ticker symbol, stock volume, opening price, and closing price. I then calculated the quarterly change in dollar amount and percentage change, as well as the total stock volume for each stock.

To enhance the output, I added functionality to identify and display the stock with the greatest percentage increase, the greatest percentage decrease, and the greatest total volume. I also applied conditional formatting to the "quarterly change" and "percentage change" columns to visually highlight positive changes in green and negative changes in red. For improved efficiency, I ensured the VBA script runs across all the worksheets in the workbook (representing multiple quarters) at once, allowing the script to handle large datasets effectively.
